# Brief Summary
This program is a C# Blazor Website meant to present training videos to a user. After the user has watched the training video, a button should appear for them to click that will take them to a test convering the video. If they get all questions right on that test, it then allows them to submit the test results. These will be emailed to the appropriate channels.
